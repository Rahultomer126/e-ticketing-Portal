      <h2>Humayuns Tomb</h2>
      Predating the Taj Mahal by 60 years, and echoing the sentiment behind its creation where a grieving husband built a mausoleum in the memory of his beloved wife, the Humayun’s Tomb was the result of a wife’s love for her deceased husband. Incorporating Persian and Mughal architectural elements, this one-of-a-kind garden tomb was built mid-16th century in the memory of Mughal Emperor Humayun by his Persian-born first wife, Haji Begum. The interspersing of red sandstone and white marble in its arched facades is the striking feature of this mausoleum that from a distance seems to hover mid air. Little wonder, the grand scale of the structure, the Islamic geometry, restrained decoration, and the symmetrical gardens are believed to be an inspiration for the Taj Mahal in Agra. </div>

        <h2>Hauz Khas</h2>
        Amidst the posh neighbourhoods of South Delhi, lies the historical site of the Hauz Khas complex. Hauz Khas dates back to the early 14th century during the reign of Ala-ud-Din Khalji. The site preserves an ancient water reservoir that was built by Ala-ud-Din Khalji to supply water to the inhabitants of Siri Fort.
        The major tourist attractions in and around the Hauz Khas complex are the Royal Tank (Hauz Khas), Siri Fort, Madrasa, Firuz Shah Tughlaq's tomb and the cultural essence of the Hauz Khas village. Today its vicinity hosts many ethnic restaurants, bars, pubs and cafes.
        The Siri Fort was built between 1297 CE and 1307 CE to defend against Mongol invasions of India and Delhi. The Fort served as the seat of the Khilji Dynasty. In the later years the fort was linked to the fortifications of Jahanpanah, a township that was built by Mohammad Bin Tughlak. Siri is believed to be one of the oldest cities of Delhi. The Siri Fort still holds the prominent structures of palaces, doors, mosques, gates and bastions.      </div>

                      Bhangarh is perhaps one of India’s most haunted locations. It is in Rajasthan and even the government has declared it an unsafe place to visit at night. India’s Archeological Survey or ASI body also placed a sign outside of Bhangarh Fort to warn visitors and locals alike not to reach their premises after sunset and before sunrise. While the government does not freely recognise the existence of any supernatural force here, the board says it all and is ample proof that there exists something that is not to be played with.</div>

You, of course, understand that in the desert of Rajasthan, it is a practical water management solution. It also serves as a natural cooler in summer months. But, what inspired the people of those days to build it so beautifully. Were all the public spaces so beautiful in 9th CE? I wonder how India would have looked then.</div>

                                                          <h2>Cave, Temple & Inscriptions, Bhaja</h2>
                                                            Bhaja Caves or Bhaje caves is a group of 22 rock-cut caves dating back to the 2nd century BC located in Pune district, near Lonavala, Maharashtra. The caves are 400 feet above the village of Bhaja, on an important ancient trade route running from the Arabian Sea eastward into the Deccan Plateau (the division between North India and South India). The inscriptions and the cave temple are protected as a Monument of National Importance, by the Archaeological Survey of India per Notification No. 2407-A. It belongs to the Hinayana Buddhism sect in Maharashtra. The caves have a number of stupas, one of their significant features. The most prominent excavation is its chaitya (or chaityagrha – Cave XII), a good example of the early development of this form from wooden architecture, with a vaulted horseshoe ceiling. Its vihara (Cave XVIII) has a pillared verandah in front and is adorned with unique reliefs. These caves are notable for their indications of the awareness of wooden architecture. The carvings prove that tabla – a percussion instrument – was used in India for at least two thousand years. The carving shows a woman playing tabla and another woman, performing dance.       </div>

The work of construction of the fort started in 19 March 1680. In 1662, he strengthened and fortified Kolaba fort to make it one of his chief naval stations. The command of the fort was given to Darya Sagar and Manik Bhandari under whom Kolaba fort became the centre of the Maratha attacks on British ships.[3] Kolaba fort is one the fort which was captured by Shivaji Maharaj. The fort was completed by Sambhaji Maharaj after the death of Shivaji Maharaj in June 1681. In 1713 under a treaty with Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath, Kolaba along with several other forts was given over to Kshtriya koli king shrimant Kanhoji Raje Angre. He used it as his main base from which to launch raids on British ships. In 17 November 1721, the British incensed at Angre’s activities, joined the Portuguese in an expedition against Kolaba.                </div>
